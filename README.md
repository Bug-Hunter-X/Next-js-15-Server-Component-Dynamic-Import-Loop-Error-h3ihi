# Next.js 15 Server Component Dynamic Import Loop Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js 15 related to dynamic imports within loops inside server components. The bug results in unpredictable behavior and runtime errors due to asynchronous operations not being handled properly during server-side rendering (SSR).

## Bug Description

When dynamically importing modules inside a loop within a server component, if the imports are not properly awaited or their resolved data is accessed before resolution, it can lead to undefined values or runtime exceptions.  This issue is amplified when dealing with a substantial number of dynamic imports.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that all dynamic imports are properly awaited using `Promise.all` before accessing their data. This synchronizes the operations, preventing issues caused by asynchronous execution during SSR.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Observe the error in the browser console (or lack thereof after applying the fix).
